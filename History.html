<h1><a href="History.html">History</a></h1>
<p><strong>History </strong>(from
 Greek &#7985;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&#943;&alpha;, historia, meaning 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by 
investigation') is the study of the past. Events occurring before the 
invention of writing systems are considered prehistory. "History" is an 
umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, 
discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of
 information about these events. Scholars who focus on history are 
called historians. The historian's role is to place the past in context,
 using sources from moments and events, and filling in the gaps to the 
best of their ability. Written documents are not the only sources 
historians use to develop their understanding of the past. They also use
 material objects, oral accounts, ecological markers, art, and artifacts
 as historical sources.</p>

<p>History also
 includes the academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, 
examine, question, and analyze a sequence of past events, investigate 
the patterns of cause and effect that are related to them. Historians 
seek to understand and represent the past through narratives. They often
 debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the 
significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate the
 nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the 
discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" 
on the problems of the present.</p>

<p>Stories 
common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources 
(such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as 
cultural heritage or legends. History differs from myth in that it is 
supported by evidence. However, ancient influences have helped spawn 
variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over
 the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history
 is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the 
study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical 
investigation. History is often taught as part of primary and secondary 
education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in 
university studies.</p>

<p>Herodotus, a
 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered (within the Western 
tradition) to be the "father of history," or, by some, the "father of 
lies." Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the 
foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue 
to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and 
the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or 
approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state chronicle, 
the Spring and Autumn Annals, was known to be compiled from as early as 
722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Historians 
write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the 
current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write
 to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto 
Croce, "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by 
the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of 
narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race. The 
modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional 
production of this discourse.</p>

<p>All events 
that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the 
historical record. The task of historical discourse is to identify the 
sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate
 accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's 
archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by 
invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying 
their claims to represent the "true past"). Part of the historian's role
 is to skillfully and objectively utilize the vast amount of sources 
from the past, most often found in the archives. The process of creating
 a narrative inevitably generates a silence as historians remember or 
emphasize different events of the past.</p>

<p>The study of
 history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at 
other times as part of the social sciences. It can also be seen as a 
bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from 
both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other 
classification. In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel 
revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines 
as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global 
history.</p>

<p>Traditionally,
 historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by 
passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical 
questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From
 the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, 
inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical 
knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what 
is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult 
all three. But writing is the marker that separates history from what 
comes before.</p>

<p>Archaeology 
is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites 
and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. 
But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to 
complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a 
range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from 
history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within 
textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch 
of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of 
contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and
 interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; has sought to 
understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material 
record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of 
wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, 
despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this 
time.</p>

<p>There are 
varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including 
chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically. These 
divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant intersections are 
often present. It is possible for historians to concern themselves with 
both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend 
has been toward specialization. The area called Big History resists this
 specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History 
has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also 
may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.</p>
