<h1><a href="index.html">Geography</a></h1>
<p><strong>Geography </strong>(from
 Greek: &gamma;&epsilon;&omega;&gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&#943;&alpha;, geographia, literally "earth description") is a field
 of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, 
and phenomena of the Earth and planets. The first person to use the word
 &gamma;&epsilon;&omega;&gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&#943;&alpha; was Eratosthenes (276-194 BC). Geography is an 
all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its
 human and natural complexities-not merely where objects are, but also 
how they have changed and come to be.</p>

<p">Geography is
 often defined in terms of two branches: human geography and physical 
geography. Human geography is concerned with the study of people and 
their communities, cultures, economies, and interactions with the 
environment by studying their relations with and across space and place.
 Physical geography is concerned with the study of processes and 
patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, 
biosphere, and geosphere.</p>

<p>The four 
historical traditions in geographical research are spatial analyses of 
natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, 
studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography 
has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human
 and the physical sciences".</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Geography is
 a systematic study of the Universe and its features. Traditionally, 
geography has been associated with cartography and place names. Although
 many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not 
their main preoccupation. Geographers study the space and the temporal 
database distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as 
the interaction of humans and their environment. Because space and place
 affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants 
and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The 
interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an 
attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena 
and its spatial patterns.</p>

<p>Geography as
 a discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields: 
human geography and physical geography. The former largely focuses on 
the built environment and how humans create, view, manage, and influence
 space. The latter examines the natural environment, and how organisms, 
climate, soil, water, and landforms produce and interact. The difference
 between these approaches led to a third field, environmental geography,
 which combines physical and human geography and concerns the 
interactions between the environment and humans.</p>

<h2>Techniques</h2>

<p>As spatial 
interrelationships are key to this synoptic science, maps are a key 
tool. Classical cartography has been joined by a more modern approach to
 geographical analysis, computer-based geographic information systems 
(GIS).</p>

<p>In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systematic - Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regional - Examines systematic relationships between 
categories for a specific region or location on the planet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descriptive - Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analytical - Asks why we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.</p>

<h2>Cartography</h2>

<p>Cartography 
studies the representation of the Earth's surface with abstract symbols 
(map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps 
for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract 
enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a 
collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.</p>

<p>Cartographers
 must learn cognitive psychology and ergonomics to understand which 
symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively, and 
behavioural psychology to induce the readers of their maps to act on the
 information. They must learn geodesy and fairly advanced mathematics to
 understand how the shape of the Earth affects the distortion of map 
symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, 
without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the 
larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood 
fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.</p>
